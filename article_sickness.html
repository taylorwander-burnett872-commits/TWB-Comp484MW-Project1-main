                    <p>There have been recent national concerns regarding reports of a mysterious illness affecting the community of Raccoon City. While public discussion has led to understandable questions, Umbrella Corporation would like to assure citizens that we are actively investigating the situation and working closely with local authorities to ensure it remains contained and confined.</p><br>
                        <p>Public health and safety have always been among Umbrella’s highest priorities. Our pharmaceutical and medical research divisions are dedicating extensive resources to identifying the cause of these reported symptoms and providing support where needed. Though isolated incidents can sometimes give rise to speculation, we encourage the public to remain calm and rely on verified information from trusted sources.</p><br>
                        <p>Our investigations into the issue have led us to hypothesize that these signs of sickness are not viral in nature at all. Umbrella has reason to suspect that these symptoms are perhaps being caused by and uptick in radioactive activity closer to the city center. Another possible explanation could be mass delusions caused by gas leaks due to Raccoon Cities aging infrastrucure, a problem Umbrella has already poured much time and money into to remedy.</p><br>
                        <p>Regardless of the true cause of this sickness, there are practical steps every citizen can take to protect themselves and their loved ones from viral illnesses of any kind:</p><br>

                        <h2>1. Practice Thorough Hygiene</h2><br>

                        <p>Wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, particularly after contact with public surfaces. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth, without first cleaning your hands.</p><br>

                        <h2>2. Avoid Direct Contact with the Ill</h2><br>

                        <p>If someone appears unwell—exhibiting fever, disorientation, or unusual aggression, then it would be in your best interest to maintain a safe distance and notify local health authorities <b>immediately.</b> Early reporting allows professionals to respond quickly and effectively.</p><br>

                        <h2>3. Strengthen Your Immune System</h2><br>

                        <p><img src="Images\tory-miles-tory-miles-prop-signage-pill-poster-v04.jpg" alt="logo" height="370" width="310" class="flowRight"/>A balanced diet, adequate rest, and proper hydration remain fundamental defenses against infection. Umbrella’s line of nutritional supplements can also help support immune health during times of heightened concern. Consider stocking up on some of Umbrella's world renowned green-herb supplements or perhaps consider trying our brand new green-red combo supplements. Regardless of your choice, Umbrella has your back.</p><br>

                        <h2>4. Stay Informed</h2><br>

                        <p>Follow guidance from local officials and public safety announcements. Avoid spreading unverified rumors that may cause unnecessary panic or confusion. Be cautious of misinformation, even from seemingly reputable sources, such as the Raccoon City Police Department. We at Umbrella have reason to believe that certain subsets of the RPD, namely the S.T.A.R.S division, have been intentionally spreading false information in order to cause panic and discredit our efforts to contain this sickness. Do not listen to anything they say and instead make sure to rely on information from trusted sources, such as our own news network, UNN.</p><br>

                        <h2>5. Secure Your Household</h2><br>

                        <img src="Images\firstaidspray.png" alt="logo" height="310" width="370" class="flowLeft"/><p>Ensure doors and windows are properly locked, especially at night. While there is no indication of widespread threat, general preparedness is always a wise precaution. In times like these, while it is always important to help one's neighbor, we reccomend a distanced approach. Should anyone request or demand entry into your home, do not hesitate to deny them. Consider investing in home security measures and maintaining a well-stocked emergency kit with essentials such as water, non-perishable food, and first aid supplies. For your convience, Umbrella can provide you with all of these products and more at your local pharmacy or supermarket.</p><br>

                        <p>Umbrella Corporation continues to monitor developments around the clock. Our scientists and medical professionals are working tirelessly to understand the nature of this illness and to implement effective countermeasures. We are confident that with responsible community cooperation and swift scientific action, this situation will be resolved promptly.</p><br>

                        <p>If we all do our part—staying vigilant, practicing healthy habits, and trusting in the expertise of trained professionals—this will be over in no time.

                        As it stands, Umbrella will remain committed to safeguarding the future of Raccoon City and beyond.</p>
