                <h1>Umbrella Supports Raccoon City Development and Infrastructure</h1><br>
                <p>Raccoon City has long since been one of Umbrellas most helpful and dedicated partners. Raccoon City has been so welcoming of us that the city has become know to all as the 'Home of Umbrella'. Now us at Umbrella feel that it's time to pay it forward. Take a look at some of the recent ways Umbrella has returned the favor and given back to the community!</p><br>

                    <p>Umbrella's relationship with Raccoon City goes almost as far back as Umbrella itself. In the early 1970's, Umbrella was looking for a place to set up shop in the United States so as to better continue their magnanamus pursuit of a better future for all of humanity. Raccoon City stood tall as the city most perfectly suited to the needs of Umbrella and so we made the decsion to anchor our US branch in this most wonderful of cities</p><br>
                    <p>Since then, Umbrella has been a proud partner of Raccoon City and has done everything in our power to support the city and its citizens. From sponsoring local events to donating to local charities, Umbrella has always been there for Raccoon City just as much as Raccoon City has been there for us. We have also made it a point to hire as many local residents as possible in order to provide jobs and economic growth to the city.</p><br>
                    <p>Recently, us here at Umbrella have decided to launch a campaign to triple the amount of support we provide to the city so as to celebrate our over 25 years of continued partnership. We wanted to take the time today to highlight some of those efforts and bring some attention to all of the good our campaign has brought to the community.</p><br>
                    <h2>Raccoon General Hospital</h2><br>
                    <p>Raccoon General Hospital has been a staple of the Raccoon City community since its construction in 1992. The hospital has provided care and support to the citizens of Raccoon City for years since then and we at Umbrella wanted to do our part to support their efforts. That is why we have recently launched a partnership with Raccoon General Hospital in order to provide them with the funding they need to continue providing top-notch care to the community.</p><br>
                    <p>The Umbrella Corporation is delighted to announce that we will be making an additional large $650,000 donation to the hospital on top of the donation we provided to the hospital in July. Furthermore, Umbrella has made the decision to nearly double the scope of our partnerhsip program announced in early July.</p><br>
                    <p>Through this partnership, we will be providing the hospital with a steady stream of brand new pharmaceuticals to be used in their treatments. We will also be providing the hospital with funding as per needed for new equipment and technology to help them continue providing top-notch care to the community.</p><br>
                    <p>Finally, Umbrella has launced a mobile care division composed of some of our most esteemed Doctors and Researchers. These proffesionals will be providing their services to Raccoon General Hospital free of charge starting as early as next week.</p>
                    <h2>Raccoon City Police Department</h2><br>
                    <p>Raccoon City Police Department has been a great partner of ours for years now. We have always had a great relationship with the RPD and we wanted to do our part to support them as well. That is why we have recently launched a partnership with the RPD in order to provide them with the funding they need to continue keeping the citizens of Raccoon City safe.</p><br>
                    <p>Us at Umbrella are thus proud to announce that the RPD will be receiving a donation of $550,000. Police chief Brian Irons had this to say regarding Umbrellas decision to provide the RPD with such a large amount of money <q>Ever since I've assumed the position of Police Chief at the Raccoon City Police Department, The Umbrella Corporation has been a wonderful ally to myself and all of my men. I extend only the deepest of gratitude towards Umbrella and hope that our partnership will continue for many more years to come.</q></p><br>
                    <p>When asked how the RPD plans to use the funding provided by the Umbrella Corporation, Chief Irons mentioned how, thanks to our funding, they've already made the move to hire brand new officers such as Officer Leon Kennedy, whom Irons stated, will be joining the RPD in late September.</p><br>
                    <h2>Raccoon City Department of Public Works</h2><br>
                    <p>The history of Raccoon City goes back very far, further than Umbrella even! That is why, for years, the RDPW has had to deal with unstable and outdated electrical and sewer systems.</p><br>
                    <p>Umbrella has thus decided to put together an experienced team of public works experts whom will dedicate themselves to upgrading these outdated systems in conjunction with the RDPW.</p><br>
                    <p>The first step will be upgrading the cities sewage systems, the early phases of which have already begun.</p><br>
                    <p>We're excited about what this will ultimately mean for Raccoon City and we can't wait to see where this project will go.</p><br>
                    <h2>Private Task Forces</h2>
                    <p>In addition to all of these efforts, Umbrella has launched their own private task force in the Umbrella Balanced Community Support team, or the U.B.C.S for short. This team of dedicated and highly capapble individuals will function as supplemental support to all of the areas of Raccoon City mentioned above and much much more.</p><br>
                    <p>We at Umbrella are so excited to see the impact that our efforts will have on Raccoon City and we can't wait to see what the future holds for our partnership! We're look forward to many more years of continued collaboration with Raccoon City and its wonderful inhabitants and we hope you are too.</p>
