                <h1>Edward Ashford: Honoring an Umbrella Legend</h1><br>
                <p>We at Umbrella rightfully like to celebrate the accomplishments and achievements of our founder, Oswell E. Spencer. Spencer would not have been able to launch Umbrella the way he did however, without the help of one man: Edward Ashford, co-founder of Umbrella Pharmaceuticals. While the late Ashford may not have lived long enough to see the Umbrella corporation as it stands today, he would no doubt be proud of the work his good friend and confidant has been able to accomplish. Let us honor and remember Ashford by taking a look at the legacy he left behind.</p><br>
